# Johari Window

<div align='center'>Currently in development</div>

Application for users to perform a [johari window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) with their peers for a bit of fun and self-enlightenment.

I'm hoping to incorporate chatGPT's API to perform a minimal analysis after the window has been made.

Flask would have been more appropriate as the project scope is relatively small, but i just wanted to learn Django 🤷🏻‍♂️
