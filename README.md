<h1 align='center'>Johari Window</h1>

<div align='center'>
<b>Currently in development</b>
</div>

</br>Application for users to perform a [johari window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) with their peers for a bit of fun and self-enlightenment.

I'm hoping to incorporate chatGPT's API to perform a minimal analysis after the window has been made.
